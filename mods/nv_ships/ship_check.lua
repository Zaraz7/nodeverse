--[[
This file contains functions that scan all of a ship's nodes to modify them in
certain ways or compute global properties for the ship. In particular, they
ensure that all nodes respect orientation constraints, so the player has to
worry as little as possible about properly orienting them, and also check
whether the ship is appropriately built and should be allowed to take off.
