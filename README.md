# Nodeverse

This is a procedurally generated space exploration game, inspired by No Man's
Sky and other similar titles, but built around voxel mechanics. It features an
immensely large universe with a never-ending variety of planets to explore.

## Status
An infinite cloud of floating planets is created. Blocks include stone, gravel,
dust, sediment, water, hydrocarbon, lava, grass soil, grass, dry grass, tall
grass and snow. Planets of different colors, rockier, more hilly or flat, richer
in oceans, arid, frozen, volcanic, and with or without living organisms are
generated. World generation features oceans, caves, deserts and craters.

The player can fly using a rocket that they start with. They have a limited
amount of fuel to fly the furthest they can.
