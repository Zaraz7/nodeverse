# Rocket

This mod grants the player the ability to fly using a rocket. The rocket works
as an item that can be placed on the world and right-clicked to use. The player
model is set to that of the rocket until they land or die. Upon death, flown
distance is shown, and personal or server-wide records are announced.

This is only a temporary solution until better game mechanics are implemented.
