# Palettes

The palettes in this directory were automatically generated using the scripts
`generate.scm` and `split.sh`. If you want to edit these palettes, edit those
files as desired and follow the instructions contained in them. Note that some
of the color palettes are generated both as files within this directory and at
runtime, and both versions should match. Read `generate.scm` for specific
instructions. The scripts are meant to be run in a Unix-like environment.
