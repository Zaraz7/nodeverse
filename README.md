This is a procedurally generated space exploration game, inspired by No Man's
Sky and other similar titles, but built around voxel mechanics. It features an
immensely large universe with a never-ending variety of planets to explore.

It is still in very early development, but a simple proof-of-concept game has
been built on top of the code to make it playable. Since this is an
[early](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4) release version, it is expected that
any following versions will make breaking changes to the core game.

## Status
A universe with tens of thousands of planets is created. Blocks include stone, gravel,
dust, sediment, water, hydrocarbon, lava, grass soil, grass, dry grass, tall grass,
ice and snow. Planets of different colors, rockier, more hilly or flat, richer in
oceans, arid, frozen, volcanic, with or without living organisms, and with various
terrain shapes and cave abundance are generated. World generation features oceans,
ice sheets, caves, cliffs, deserts and craters.

The player starts out flying a small, boring spaceship near the ground. Pressing
'sneak' (shift by default) will land it. After landing, it's possible to unboard
('move') or lift off ('jump'). A ship can be boarded by pressing 'use' (right-
click by default) on any of its nodes.

By flying high into the sky, outer space will be reached. From there, it's possible
to travel to other planets and stars via the inventory GUI. Information about each
will be shown as well. To return to the planet, descend into it ('sneak').

Most planets have a colorful pi√±ata standing somewhere over their surface.
Finding and breaking it affords new spaceship parts as random loot.
These parts can be used to modify one's ship or create a new one.
