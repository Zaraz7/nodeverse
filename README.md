This is a procedurally generated space exploration game, inspired by No Man's
Sky and other similar titles, but built around voxel mechanics. It features an
immensely large universe with a never-ending variety of planets to explore.

It is still in early development, but some of the final playable mechanics are
already in place. Since this is an
[early](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4) release version, it is expected that
any following versions will make breaking changes to the core game.

## Status
A universe with tens of thousands of planets is created. Each has its own terrain
shapes, climate, colors, flora...

The player starts out flying a small, boring spaceship near the ground. Pressing
'sneak' (shift by default) will land it. After landing, it's possible to unboard
('move') or lift off ('jump'). A ship can be boarded by pressing 'use' (right-
click by default) on any of its nodes.

By flying high into the sky, outer space will be reached. From there, it's possible
to travel to other planets and stars via the inventory GUI. Information about each
will be shown as well, plus a list of any discovered planets and flora.
To return to the planet, descend into it ('sneak').

Most planets have a colorful pi√±ata standing somewhere over their surface.
Finding and breaking it affords new spaceship parts as random loot.
These parts can be used to modify one's ship or create a new one.
