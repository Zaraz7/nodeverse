# NV Ships
NV Ships is a Minetest mod that adds buildable, boardable air/spacecraft. To
this end, it registers a number of nodes that the player can place in order to
build these ships, and offers the ability to right-click (use) any node of the
structure to board it. After boarding, the ship can be easily controlled with
the direction keys and jump/sneak controls. To land, simply hold sneak at a
relatively low height.
